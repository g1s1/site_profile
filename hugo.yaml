    content: |-
      I am a clinical psychologist with a Ph.D. in digital health from the [Center of Digital Interventions](https://www.c4dhi.org/) @ ETH Zürich. 
      Currently, I work as a psychotherapist in training at the University Hospital of Old Age Psychiatry and Psychotherapy 
      ([UPD Bern](https://www.upd.ch/)) and as a group lead (Post-Doc) under [Prof. Dr. med. Stefan Klöppel](https://www.upd.unibe.ch/about_us/people/prof_dr_med_kloeppel_stefan/index_eng.html)
      at the [University of Bern](https://www.upd.unibe.ch/). My research focuses on digital interventions 
      and biomarkers for the prevention, diagnosis, prediction, treatment, and monitoring of mental disorders. 
      My main focus is depression in younger and older populations. To advance the field of mental health, I try to combine 
      my expertise in psychology, computational neuroscience, and digital health. My work aims 
      to improve patient outcomes and adherence, as well as provide countermeasures to the increasing healthcare costs.
      
      In addition to my scientific work, I work with [ViViRA](https://www.vivira.com/) — a digital therapeutic reimbursable 
      under the German Healthcare Act — to improve the real-world effectiveness and 
      adherence of treatments for musculoskeletal diseases. In this work, I support the development of an innovative solution that increases patient engagement and health outcomes.

          During my employement at the (Center for Digital Health Interventions)["https://www.c4dhi.org/"] 
          at ETH Zurich,
          I concepted, planned, and conducted a field waitlist-control study to develop a digital biomarker for 
          symptoms and severity of subclinical depression, anxiety, and stress. 
          We developed and deployed a smartphone app to combined a slow-paced-breathing training (Breeze), a 
          chatbot (BEDDA), voice commands, and daily actional advice. Fir the analysis we recruited more than 150 
          participants.
          Besides this main study I planned and conducted various further studies in the field of linguistic 
          big data (N-Gram), systematic reviews (App Store and investment reviews), meta-analysis (physical 
          activity), and digital health (expert commentary) leading to several peer-reviewed publications.
          Besides my research I applied for funding from our industry partner 
          [CSS health insurance](https://www.css.ch/de/privatkunden.html) (approx. 90k CHF).

          solve a visual classification task. However, my model was unable to replicate the behavior of border ownership neurons in the monkey's brain.
